Science is a journey of curiosity, observation, and understanding. 
Through careful analysis and persistent inquiry, 
we uncover patterns in nature and formulate principles that help us explain the world around us.

This book is the result of dedicated research and aims to contribute to the growing body of scientific knowledge. 
It is written with the hope that it may inspire further exploration, critical thinking, and informed discussion.

Let this be an invitation to think deeply, question boldly, and learn continually.
